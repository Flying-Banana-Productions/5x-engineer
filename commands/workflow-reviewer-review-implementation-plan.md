We are reviewing the implementation plan document $1.

Read all related design documentation and existing implementation, and review the plan from a Staff Engineer perspective, providing an overall implementation ready decision in edition to detailed change requests.

If there is an existing review document, write your assessment to the same document as a new addendum; otherwise create a new review document in @docs/development/reviews. Use  _review_template.md from the folder as the review format if available, otherwise follow existing conventions.
